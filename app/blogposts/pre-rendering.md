# Welcome to My Blog

Hello and welcome! I’m excited to kick off this blog to share my journey, ideas, and projects with you. Here’s a little bit about me:

I’m a dedicated software engineering student with a keen interest in backend development, especially API integrations and optimizing server-side logic. My background spans diverse interests, from working as a personal injury attorney to building projects with frameworks like Next.js and Tailwind CSS. I'm also working on my own projects like DannyBlog, a personal blog project where I get to experiment with Next.js and DaisyUI.

In my free time, I enjoy solving complex problems, learning new algorithms, and exploring ways technology can intersect with law and business. I’m currently enhancing my skills through a CS 224 Computer Systems course, where I dive deep into Y86-64 simulation and low-level programming.

This blog is a space where I’ll be sharing insights from my experiences, technical tutorials, and project updates. Stay tuned as I document my learning journey and share helpful tips for fellow developers, students, and aspiring entrepreneurs!

Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to reach out or comment – I’d love to connect!
